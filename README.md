# Quantum-Simulator

A Quantum Simulator program utilizing matrix operations to simulate a quantum system capable of reproducing pseudo fundamentals of superposition and entanglement. This program however constitutes to perform operations on 2 qubits only. As limited to its 2 qubit operation versatality, this is still capable of multi-gate measurements. In addition to this, parametric gates are also enabled for inputs in variables with angles and radians.

## Current capabilities
- [x] Initialise state vectors.
- [x] Read program to calculate matrix operator for specific gates.
- [x] Modify the state by applying operators.
- [x] Perform multishot measurement of all qubits using weighted random technique.
- [x] Can run parametric gates.
- [x] Can run unitaries for radians.

## Requirements
- Python (3.5 or above preferred)
- NumPy
- math (inbuilt in py)
- itertools (inbuilt in py)
- *Human with enough interest and patience to study this*

## Future features to be added
- [ ] Allow parameterized gates in matrix operations.
- [ ] Run variational quantum algorithms.
