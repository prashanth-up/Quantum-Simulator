So best we can get as output from quantum computer is bitstring of size $n$ where $n$ is number of qubits. Reading the state from a qubit is called \"measurement\". When qubit is in superposition, measurment puts qubit in one of two classical states. If we read 1 from qubit, it will \"collapse\" to state |1> and will stay there - superposition is \"destroyed\", and any subsequent measurement will return the same result.\n",
